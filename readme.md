# COVID-19 Tutorial

Welcome to the COVID-19 Tutorial repository. This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks designed to help you understand and analyze COVID-19 Natural Product Discovery data. Please note that this tutorial is a work in progress, and additional parts will be published over time.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow the steps below to clone the repository, create a virtual environment, and install the required packages.

### Cloning the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xevworks/covid-tutorial.git
cd covid-tutorial
```

### Creating a Virtual Environment

Next, create a virtual environment to manage the dependencies for this project. You can use `venv` to create the virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv env
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:
    ```bash
    .\env\Scripts\activate
    ```
- On macOS and Linux:
    ```bash
    source env/bin/activate
    ```

### Installing Dependencies

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You are now ready to start working with the notebooks in this repository.
